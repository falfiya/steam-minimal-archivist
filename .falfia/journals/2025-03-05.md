How should insertion into the database work? I think first we have to build up a list of strings and intern them all. Then we just insert regularly.

Basically the data has to be done from the bottom up. First all interning has to happen. Next we need to intern the `more`s. Finally we can begin doing the snapshot.

I think the way that I'll do this is that the database will be responsible for everything bottom-up. That is to say that it is the databases job to intern things. It will be the application's job to make sure the parent foreign keys exist.

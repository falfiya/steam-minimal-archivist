I have a free morning to work on this. I think I would like to make a diagram for the database first.

It took a while to figure out what my goals were:

- Minimizing un-compressed data size
   - Interning as much data as possible
- Making a sensible format

I almost interned every value and gave each an id and referenced them... but like that doesn't make any sense. A reference is still just another integer and that adds another layer of indirection. The only way interning stuff makes sense is if the data you're interning is a good bit larger than an integer. Then you can save storage.

I think some indexes will need to be made so that this is fast but I'll leave that off for the next time.

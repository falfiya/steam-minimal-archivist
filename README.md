*Unfancy Steam Archivist*

Steam doesn't keep track of play-time on specific dates so let's do it ourselves. `steam-minimal-archivist` takes a snapshot of your Steam play-time per game, along with some other stuff.

I recommend setting it up to run periodically. Maybe have it run on login, or run once a day. Do it whenever it suits you. Mine runs whenever my computer is idle for more than 15 minutes using the WindowsÂ® Task Scheduler.

## Requirements

- Node.js
   - I have `v20.7.0` and it works fine
- Node Package Manager
   - I'm using version `10.1.0`
- GNU Make
- A Valid Steam API Key
   - Visit https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey to obtain one

## Dependencies

You'll have to build the executable JavaScript yourself though.

- runtime
   - Node.js
   - `better-sqlite3`
- build time
   - `typescript`
   - `@types/node`
   - `@types/better-sqlite3`
   - `esbuild`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and `cd into it`
   - `git clone https://github.com/falfiya/steam-minimal-archivist.git && cd steam-minimal-archivist`
2. `npm i` to install all required packages
3. `make`

On your first run, you will be prompted for your Steam API Key and a `.config.json` file will be created.
Then, add some users to archive.
You can either use a full URL or a Steam User ID.
Your `.config.json` file might look something like this:

```json
{
   "key": "YOUR_KEY_HERE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "userIds": ["9876543210987654"],
   "userUrls": [
      "https://steamcommunity.com/id/abcdef/",
      "https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/12345678901234567",
      "https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghijkl",
      "https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/89012345678901234/",
   ]
}
```

**Do not share this file since it has your API key inside!**

## What's Archived

`steam-minimal-archivist` is a snapshot-based archiver. A single snapshot contains:

- A User's
   - Steam Id
   - Username
   - Profile URL
   - Avatar
   - Last Logoff Time
   - "Real Name" <sup>it's whatever they set in their Steam profile</sup>
   - Creation Time
   - Steam Level
   - Games
      - Minutes Played
         - Platform Specific
            - On Windows
            - On Macintosh
            - On Linux
      - Minutes Played in the Last Two Weeks
      - Last Played Time

## How to View Your Data

`steam-minimal-archivist`'s functionality is limited to archiving. If you'd like to make an application to display or export your data, please reference the schema located in `src/schema.sql`. The data is stored in a sqlite3 database.

## Directory Structure

- TypeScript and SQL source files in `src/`
- executable JavaScript files in `js/`
- archives in `data/`

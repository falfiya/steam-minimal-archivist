   A year later and I still haven't gotten around to making a newer version of this. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And I'm a busy college student. I will revert to snapshot functionality instead of diffs. Less chance of error.
   I am appreciative that this is all self-contained. The entire SteamApi functionality is written out right here and that makes stuff very simple. Super good idea. I must remember to make minimal projects like this in the future.

   These comments are also great:
   // this program assumes that the CWD is the repository root!

   // ArchiveDatabase and Config have ::new-style constructors and so to keep things
   // consistent, SteamApi will be the same.

   That's the best! That's something I want to know!

   I'm a little worried about database performance. I haven't made any indexes and I'm not sure if sqlite is still efficient without them. In the next version, it might be worth looking into. With that said, the next version probably shouldn't be in TypeScript and could be much more robust. If performance is starting to become an issue, it might be time to start thinking of a steam-nonminimal-archivist.

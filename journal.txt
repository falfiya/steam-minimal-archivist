   I'm a little worried about database performance. I haven't made any indexes and I'm not sure if sqlite is still efficient without them. In the next version, it might be worth looking into. With that said, the next version probably shouldn't be in TypeScript and could be much more robust. If performance is starting to become an issue, it might be time to start thinking of a steam-nonminimal-archivist.
